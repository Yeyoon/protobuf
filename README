A Common Lisp implementation of Google's protocol buffers.

The code here is a preliminary release.  It contains low-level routines for
encoding and decoding protocol buffer types, such as integers and strings,
but the translator from protocol buffer descriptions to Lisp code is
currently unimplemented.

The distribution does include two files that show what translated protocol
buffer code might look like:  testprotocol.lisp and proto-test.lisp.

The code has been tested with ABCL, CCL, CLISP, and SBCL.  In the past it
has also worked with Allegro Common Lisp, but I have not tested it lately.


INSTALLATION
============

0. Download and install the packages that this code depends on:

    ASDF
    trivial-utf-8       not needed for Allegro, CLisp, and SBCL

Note that some Common Lisp implementations, such as SBCL, contain a copy of
the ASDF library.


1. Make protobuf.asd available to ASDF.  Either create a symbolic link to
protobuf.asd in your ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* directory or load the file into
your running Lisp with (load "protobuf.asd").


2. Compile and load the protobuf code:

    (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'protobuf)


3. Run the tests:

    (varint::test)
    (proto-lisp-test::test)
