Remove the dependency on iterate.  It is only used in a couple of places.

Port the tests to a unit test framework.

Implement a protocol buffer compiler.  There are several possible.  Here are
my favorites:

  a. Implement a new backend for Google's protocol buffer compiler that
  generates CLOS classes from protobuf descriptions.  It is unlikely that
  Google will integrate this change into their code, and it requires Lisp
  developers to use Google's protobuf syntax.

  b. Implement a new backend for Google's protocol buffer compiler that
  outputs protobuf descriptions in s-expression form.  Write a compiler in
  Lisp that translates the s-expressions into CLOS classes.  Google may be
  more receptive to integrating this change into their code, since it is
  useful for any language in the Lisp family.  Also, the change is much
  smaller, amounting to just a pretty printer.  Lisp developers can write
  protobuf descriptions as s-expressions.  The disadvantage is that it's
  more work.

Add more testing code to proto-lisp-test.lisp.
